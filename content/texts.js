Stacey quickly addressed the issues and worked with us to find the best solutions. The neighborhood is a convenient location to nearby shopping, rec center, and major roads. But also is quiet and we felt safe walking around. Stacy was respectful of our privacy and if she needed to come to the house she would notify us first. She was easy to interact with and a pleasant person overall.”\n\n- Past Tenant",
  "“You should know that every time someone visits us, eyes light up and they comment on just how beautiful this house is. Your attention to detail and thoughtfulness to this place doesn't go unnoticed. We love it here.”\n\n- Past Tenant",
  "“Stacey, I told my contractors what you saw when looking at my new townhome and they were so surprised and agreed those things you showed me should be fixed! They were so impressed I brought those things up that they asked me if I wanted to work for them... So, you have a job here in Houston if you need one!”\n\n- Past Client",
